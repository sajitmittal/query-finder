Result for test with 100000 queries (done via jmeter, since apache bench does not support this)
Number of threads: 10
Number of iterations: 10000

Error%      0%
Throughput  69.3/sec

A reason for getting low throughput will also be due to the fact that each url was read from a file which added latency.
Detailed description of the test is present in multi_table.csv file.
